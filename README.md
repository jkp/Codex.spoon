# Codex.spoon

Tiled scrollable window manager with virtual workspaces for macOS.
A [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org) Spoon, forked from
[PaperWM.spoon](https://github.com/mogenson/PaperWM.spoon).

## Why Codex?

PaperWM.spoon nailed horizontal scrolling tiling on macOS. What it lacked:

- **Virtual workspaces** -- macOS Spaces require Mission Control animations
  and can't be switched programmatically without accessibility hacks. Codex
  parks inactive windows off-screen and swaps them in instantly.
- **Performance** -- sequential Accessibility calls made workspace switching
  take seconds. Codex uses a native Swift shim (`winmove`) that parallelizes
  AX calls across apps, bringing switch time down to ~150ms.
- **App jumping** -- jump to a specific app category (browser, terminal, LLM,
  comms) with workspace awareness. Toggle-jump flips between your last two
  intentional targets.
- **Scratch workspace** -- a floating (non-tiling) workspace for transient
  windows, with Rectangle-style snap cycling.

## What Codex Adds Over PaperWM.spoon

| Feature | PaperWM.spoon | Codex |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Virtual workspaces | -- | Off-screen parking, instant switch |
| Scratch workspace | -- | Auto-floating, snap cycling |
| Jump-to-app | -- | Workspace-aware, with toggle-jump |
| Native `winmove` shim | -- | Parallel AX, animation bypass, 100ms timeout |
| Workspace-aware dispatch | -- | Same key does different things on scratch vs tiling |
| Per-side window gaps | -- | `{top=8, bottom=8, left=8, right=8}` |

Everything from PaperWM.spoon still works: horizontal tiling, scrolling,
slurp/barf, column stacking, swipe gestures, mouse dragging.

## Installation

1. Clone into your Hammerspoon Spoons directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jkp/Codex.spoon ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/Codex.spoon
```

2. Open **System Settings > Desktop & Dock**, scroll to "Mission Control":
   - Uncheck "Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use"
   - Check "Displays have separate Spaces"

The `winmove` binary is auto-built from `winmove.swift` on first load (requires
Xcode Command Line Tools).

## Quick Start

Minimal `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`:

```lua
Codex = hs.loadSpoon("Codex")
Codex.window_gap = 10
Codex:start()

Codex:bindHotkeys({
    focus_left  = {{"alt", "cmd"}, "left"},
    focus_right = {{"alt", "cmd"}, "right"},
    focus_up    = {{"alt", "cmd"}, "up"},
    focus_down  = {{"alt", "cmd"}, "down"},
    swap_left   = {{"alt", "cmd", "shift"}, "left"},
    swap_right  = {{"alt", "cmd", "shift"}, "right"},
    swap_up     = {{"alt", "cmd", "shift"}, "up"},
    swap_down   = {{"alt", "cmd", "shift"}, "down"},
    center_window   = {{"alt", "cmd"}, "c"},
    full_width      = {{"alt", "cmd"}, "f"},
    cycle_width     = {{"alt", "cmd"}, "r"},
    toggle_floating = {{"alt", "cmd", "shift"}, "escape"},
    slurp_in        = {{"alt", "cmd"}, "i"},
    barf_out        = {{"alt", "cmd"}, "o"},
})
```

`Codex:start()` begins tiling. `Codex:stop()` releases windows.

Use `Codex:bindHotkeys(Codex.default_hotkeys)` for a full set of defaults.

## Configuration

### Window Gaps

```lua
Codex.window_gap = 10                                          -- uniform
Codex.window_gap = {top = 10, bottom = 8, left = 12, right = 12}  -- per-side
```

### Window Ratios

Ratios used by `cycle_width` / `cycle_height`:

```lua
Codex.window_ratios = { 1/3, 1/2, 2/3 }
```

### External Bar

Reserve space for tools like [Sketchybar](https://github.com/felixkratz/sketchybar):

```lua
Codex.external_bar = {top = 40}
Codex.external_bar = {top = 20, bottom = 40}
```

### Window Filter

Control which apps and screens are managed:

```lua
Codex.window_filter:rejectApp("iStat Menus Status")
Codex.window_filter:setAppFilter("iTunes", { rejectTitles = "MiniPlayer" })
Codex.window_filter:setScreens({ "Built%-in Retina Display" })
Codex:start()  -- restart for filter changes
```

### Smooth Scrolling

Swipe fingers horizontally on the trackpad to scroll windows:

```lua
Codex.swipe_fingers = 3  -- 0 to disable (default)
Codex.swipe_gain = 1.0
```

### Mouse Dragging

```lua
Codex.drag_window = { "alt", "cmd" }         -- drag to reorder
Codex.lift_window = { "alt", "cmd", "shift" } -- lift out, drop to re-tile
```

### Mouse Scrolling

```lua
Codex.scroll_window = { "alt", "cmd" }
Codex.scroll_gain = 10.0
```

### Anchor Behavior

The focused window is always left-anchored at the screen edge. Two options
control how neighboring columns are positioned:

```lua
Codex.sticky_pairs = true       -- (default: true)
Codex.right_anchor_last = true  -- (default: true)
```

**`sticky_pairs`** -- When focusing a non-first column, keep the left neighbor
visible alongside it (split-screen pairing). If both windows fit on screen,
the focused window shifts right to make room. If the left neighbor is too wide,
the focused window left-anchors at the screen edge. Disable for pure
left-anchoring on every column.

**`right_anchor_last`** -- When focusing the last column, snap it to the right
edge of the screen. This eliminates dead space and gives a "filling in a known
set" feel. Disable to have the last column use the same left-anchor (or sticky
pair) logic as middle columns.

| sticky_pairs | right_anchor_last | Behavior |
|:---:|:---:|---|
| on | on | Side-by-side pairing + right-flush last column |
| on | off | Side-by-side pairing everywhere, including last column |
| off | on | Pure left-anchor + right-flush last column |
| off | off | Pure left-anchor on every column |

### Misc

```lua
Codex.center_mouse = false  -- don't center cursor on space switch (default: true)
```

## Workspaces

Workspaces are configured via `Codex.workspaces.setup()` after `Codex:start()`:

```lua
Codex.workspaces.setup({
    workspaces = {"personal", "work", "global", "scratch"},

    -- Assign apps to workspaces (unmatched apps go to the active workspace)
    appRules = {
        Safari   = "personal",
        Claude   = "personal",
        ["Google Chrome"] = "work",
        Spotify  = "global",
    },

    -- Route windows by title pattern (checked before appRules)
    titleRules = {
        { pattern = "^%[personal%]", workspace = "personal" },
        { pattern = "^%[work%]",     workspace = "work" },
    },

    -- Jump targets: category -> { workspace -> appName | {app, title, launch} }
    jumpTargets = {
        browser  = { personal = "Safari",  work = "Google Chrome" },
        terminal = {
            personal = { app = "WezTerm", title = "^%[personal%]",
                         launch = { "/Applications/WezTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/wezterm",
                                    "connect", "personal" } },
            work     = { app = "WezTerm", title = "^%[work%]",
                         launch = { "/Applications/WezTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/wezterm",
                                    "connect", "work" } },
        },
    },
})
```

**`titleRules`** match against `win:title()` using Lua patterns, checked before
`appRules`. Useful for multi-process apps like WezTerm where each mux domain
runs a separate process with a domain prefix in the window title.

**Extended jump targets** use `{app, title, launch}` tables instead of plain
strings. The `title` pattern identifies which window belongs to this target.
Window refs are cached at creation time and lazy-validated on lookup (zero AX
calls on cache hit). The `launch` command runs via `hs.task` when no matching
window exists -- useful for `wezterm connect` which spawns a new process per
invocation.

### Scratch Workspace

Set up a floating workspace where windows are never tiled:

```lua
Codex.scratch.setup("scratch")
```

Windows moved to scratch are auto-floated. Windows moved off scratch are
re-tiled. Scratch provides Rectangle-style snap cycling (`snap("left")` etc.)
and centered size cycling.

### Workspace API

```lua
Codex.workspaces.switchTo("work")           -- switch workspace
Codex.workspaces.moveWindowTo("personal")   -- move focused window
Codex.workspaces.jumpToApp("browser")       -- jump to app category
Codex.workspaces.toggleJump()               -- flip between last two targets
Codex.workspaces.toggleScratch()            -- toggle scratch workspace
Codex.workspaces.currentSpace()             -- get current workspace name
Codex.workspaces.dump()                     -- debug print all state
```

### Workspace-Aware Dispatch

Use `Codex:dispatch()` to bind the same key to different actions depending on
whether you're on a tiling or scratch workspace:

```lua
local scratch = Codex.scratch
local actions = Codex.actions.actions()

hs.hotkey.bind(meh, "m", Codex:dispatch(
    function() scratch.focus("left") end,  -- scratch action
    actions.focus_left                      -- tiling action
))
```

## Keybindings

Codex provides two binding mechanisms:

**1. `Codex:bindHotkeys(mapping)`** for tiling actions (focus, swap, resize,
slurp/barf, space switching). See `Codex.default_hotkeys` or
`Codex.actions.actions()` for the full list.

**2. Direct `hs.hotkey.bind()`** for workspace and scratch actions, since these
live outside the standard Spoon action table.

Example with workspace bindings:

```lua
local meh = {"ctrl", "alt", "shift"}
local hyper = {"ctrl", "alt", "shift", "cmd"}

-- Workspace switch
hs.hotkey.bind(meh, "1", function() Codex.workspaces.switchTo("personal") end)
hs.hotkey.bind(meh, "2", function() Codex.workspaces.switchTo("work") end)

-- Move window to workspace
hs.hotkey.bind(hyper, "1", function() Codex.workspaces.moveWindowTo("personal") end)
hs.hotkey.bind(hyper, "2", function() Codex.workspaces.moveWindowTo("work") end)

-- Jump to app
hs.hotkey.bind(meh, "b", function() Codex.workspaces.jumpToApp("browser") end)
hs.hotkey.bind(meh, "t", function() Codex.workspaces.jumpToApp("terminal") end)
```

### The `winmove` Shim

`winmove` is a Swift binary that moves/resizes windows via the Accessibility
API. It groups operations by PID and dispatches them on concurrent threads,
which amortizes AX round-trip latency across apps. Key optimizations:

- Disables `AXEnhancedUserInterface` per-app to suppress animations
- Sets size-position-size (workaround for macOS edge clamping bugs)
- 100ms AX timeout per app -- skips hung apps gracefully
- `read_only` mode reads frames in parallel without moving
- `save=true` saves current frame before parking

## Limitations

- macOS does not allow windows fully off-screen. Codex parks at the
  bottom-right corner (top-left on-screen by 1px) to avoid clamping.
- Dragging windows between spaces is unreliable. Use `moveWindowTo()`.
- Arrange screens vertically to prevent windows bleeding across displays.

## Contributing

Style conventions:
- Global variables: `PascalCase` (e.g. `Codex`)
- Local variables: `snake_case` (e.g. `local focused_window`)
- Function names: `camelCase` (e.g. `function windowEventHandler()`)
- Use `<const>` where possible
- Create local aliases for deeply nested members
